Provides a mockable [reqwest][]-like HTTP client.

Write your code generic over the [Client](trait.Client.html) trait,
and in production use [DirectClient](struct.DirectClient.html) while in testing
you can use [ReplayClient](struct.ReplayClient.html), which will record a request
the first time and replay it every time the exact same request is made in the
future.

## Examples

```rust
use reqwest_mock::{Client, DirectClient, ReplayClient, Error};
use reqwest_mock::header::UserAgent;

struct MyClient<C: Client> {
    client: C,
}

fn new_client() -> MyClient<DirectClient> {
    MyClient {
        client: DirectClient::new()
    }
}

#[cfg(test)]
fn test_client(path: &str) -> MyClient<ReplayClient> {
    MyClient {
        client: ReplayClient::new(path)
    }
}

impl<C: Client> MyClient<C> {
    /// For simplicity's sake we are not parsing the response but just extracting the
    /// response body.
    /// Also in your own code it might be a good idea to define your own `Error` type.
    pub fn get_time(&self) -> Result<String, Error> {
        let response = self.client
            .get("https://now.httpbin.org/")
            .header(UserAgent("MyClient".to_string()))
            .send()?;

        response.body_to_utf8()
    }
}
```
